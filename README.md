# Loan-Defaulters-Project

•	Industry Understanding
How banking sector works, How loan process works, from a individual point of view, starting from application to amount disbursement 
importance – during decision making we want to make some decisions that time with respect to industry we should make the decisions
•	Dataset Understanding
Given dataset dimension, categorical and numerical columns count, size of the dataset, Is the dataset enough to make the decision by modelling with the help of industry understanding, checking datatypes,etc
•	Dataset Preprocessing
Finding the missing data points, try to fill that or impute that,
Duplicate values, detecting outliers and treating that.
•	EDA – Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate – Insights
Drawing meaningful insights from the EDA, slice and dice the dataset in the every possible way to get an insight.
•	ADS Creation
The final dataset that we are going to feed the model after doing all the preprocessing works.
•	Modelling
Train-test Split is 70:30(tried all the combinations this only provides the higher accuracy)
This is a classification problem.
